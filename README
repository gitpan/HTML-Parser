This is the HTML-Parser distribution with shared libraries compiled for
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not non-CFM
68K versions.

The original of the changed files are in Mac_changed.sit.

This was compiled with Codewarrior IDE.

All tests passed on PPC and CFM68K.
crashme.t on my Centris 660AV took a couple of minuites and seemed like
really crashed, but it worked.

Consecutive use of this module would cause an error;
 # Modification of a read-only value attempted
This problem has been discussed on MacPerl-Module mailing list but still not
solved.

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell, or the installme
droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install K/KI/KIMURA/HTML-Parser-3.25-bin-1-Mac.tgz

#===================================
HTML-Parser
-----------

This is a collection of modules that parse and extract information
from HTML documents.  Bug reports and issues for discussion about
these modules can be sent to the <libwww@perl.org> mailing list.
Remember to also look at the HTML-Tree package that build on
HTML::Parser to create and extract information from HTML syntax trees.

The modules present in this collection are:

  HTML::Parser - The parser base class.  It receives arbitrary sized
        chunks of the HTML text, recognizes markup elements, and
        separates them from the plain text.  As different kinds of markup
        and text are recognized, the corresponding event handlers are
        invoked.

  HTML::Entities - Provides functions to encode and decode text with
        embedded HTML &lt;entities&gt;.

  HTML::HeadParser - A lightweight HTML::Parser subclass that extracts
        information from the <HEAD> section of an HTML document.

  HTML::LinkExtor - An HTML::Parser subclass that extracts links from
        an HTML document.

  HTML::PullParser - An alternative interface to the basic parser
        that does not require event driven programming.

  HTML::TokeParser - An HTML::PullParser subclass with fixed
        token setup and methods for extracting text.  Many simple
        parsing needs are probably best attacked with this module.



PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.004 or better.  The HTML::Tagset module should also be installed.
If you intend to use the HTML::HeadParser you probably want to install
libwww-perl too.



INSTALLATION

Just follow the usual procedure:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
