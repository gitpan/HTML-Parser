   Release 2.18

   HTML::HeadParser->parse_file will now stop parsing when the
   <body> starts as it should.

   HTML::LinkExtor more easily subclassable by introducing the
   $self->_found_link method.

   Release 2.17

   Never split words (a sequence of non-space) between two invocations
   of $self->text.  This is just a simplification of the code that tried
   not to break entities.
   
   HTML::Parser->parse_file now use smaller chunks as already
   suggested by the HTML::Parser documentation.

   Release 2.16
   
   The HTML::Parser could some times break hex entites (like &#xFFFF;)
   in the middle.

   Removed remaining forced dependencies on libwww-perl modules.  It
   means that all tests should now pass, even if libwww-perl was not
   installed previously.

   More tests.



1998-04-01   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release 2.14, HTML::* modules unbundled from libwww-perl-5.22.
