   Release 2.24

   $p->parse_file() will not close a handle passed to it any more.
   If passed a filename that can't be opened it will return undef
   instead of raising an exception, and strings like "*STDIN" are not
   treated as globs any more.

   HTML::LinkExtor knowns about background attribute of <tables>.

   suggested by the HTML::Parser documentation.

   installed previously.
